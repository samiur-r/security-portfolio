              Cybersecurity presents a significant concern for businesses in the
              contemporary landscape, and the reasons behind this are clear. A
              single data breach, whether it affects your internal systems or
              those of a trusted vendor or partner, can result in substantial
              financial losses, potentially reaching a couple million.Â

              With cyber threats constantly evolving, businesses must take
              proactive measures to safeguard their sensitive information. Two
              widely recognized frameworks for achieving this are ISO 27001 and
              SOC 2, which are industry-specific regulations and help
              organizations meet compliance requirements more efficiently.
