            The two main types of investors are institutional investors, who are
            professional investors who invest business funds on behalf of
            organizations, and retail investors, who are private investors who
            invest their personal money in select securities on their own
            accord.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>To become an institutional investor</b>, earn at least a
            bachelor's degree in finance, economics or business and gain
            experience in a specialized area of investing, like real estate,
            stocks, venture capital or angel investing.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>To become a retail investor</b>, study investment strategies and
            develop a targeted plan to build a portfolio that aligns with your
            financial interests and includes your preferred securities, like
            stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
