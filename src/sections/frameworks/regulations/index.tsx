          In today's digital age, personal data is constantly being collected,
          stored, and processed by various entities. This vast amount of
          information encompasses sensitive details such as names, addresses,
          and online activity logs, which can lead to identity theft, financial
          fraud, and reputational damage when they fall into the wrong hands.

          As consumers become increasingly aware of these risks, they demand

          has led to the emergence of data privacy regulations such as HIPAA and
